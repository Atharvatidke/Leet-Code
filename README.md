Problem Statement:

⚬ Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

⚬ Assume there is only one solution, and no more than one can be used for the same element.

⚬You can return the answer in any order.

Constraints:

`2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`

`-109 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

`-109 <= target <= 109`

Only one valid answer exists.
